Code to reproduce methods &amp; results from my Master's Thesis Project.
You can find and download my thesis dissertation at [ULisboa Repository]( http://hdl.handle.net/10451/60536).

To reproduce this project just clone or download this repository and create a Python virtual environment.
To learn how to create a virtual environment refer to [creating a virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#creating-a-virtual-environment).

If you use our data or analysis in your research, please cite us!

## System Requirements
Our code was run using the following software:
- Python version 3.10.12
- R version 4.1.2

#### Python packages to install:

See requirements.txt

To install all packages using this file just type
```
pip install requirements.txt
```
inside your python virtual environment.

#### R packages to install:

To install the IRkernel to run R in notebooks follow these [instructions](https://irkernel.github.io/installation/).

Required packages can be installed using notebook 7.
